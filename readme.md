# MicroMouse maze solving

This project implements a maze-solving algorithm for the MicroMouse competition. The algorithm is designed to navigate a maze autonomously using a predefined set of rules and strategies.

## Overview

The MicroMouse Maze Solver Algorithm is a software solution that allows a robot to explore and navigate through a maze. The algorithm utilizes various techniques to efficiently discover the maze layout, determine the optimal path, and reach the goal.
